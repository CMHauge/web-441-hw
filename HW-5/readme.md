# HW-5 Readme for Chelsey Hauge

### Frustration

I don't even know where to start this. It's 1am, the week got away from me again, and I am kind of freaking out.
I was SO excited to see we were doing object things, and thought "Oh! I know some of this stuff!"

...Boy was I wrong. The initial introductions to objects and defining their properties like color and size is something I'm familiar with, because I had to deal with Processing a couple semesters back. So I was very excited to see that, and was pretty confident that I knew what I was doing.

But then things got more complicated, because it's JavaScript, so it's naturally going to be a headache and half. So now here we are, at 1:30 in the morning, 6 1/2 hours away from the assignment being due, and I am on the struggle-bus to Struggle Town. It's been a long night. It's going to continue to be a long night, and I'd like to apologize for this rant.


### Update:
It's done. However, I still feel really lost. I kind of feel like I'm sinking rather than swimming. Kind of barely keeping my head afloat here. Some things make sense, and others just don't at all. I feel like a main problem is that I'm a *very* visual learner, so just reading the information doesn't help me much. I have to *see* it be done, and see it come together. Otherwise the information just doesn't seem to be sticking too well.

I sort of manage to get my way through each week, but I almost immediately forget everything from the previous weeks because it's just not sticking with me correctly. I think more video tutorials that are step-by-step might help more than the reading. The reading just seems to confuse me more, especially this week.
