  <h1>Pineapple on Pizza?</h1>
<p>You enter a local pizza buffet, prepared to sit down and eat your usual favorites. But tonight, you're not so lucky. As you just finish paying for your dinner before being set loose upon the pizza buffet, the man at the register informs you that tonight is a special event night. He explains, "As a request from a local group, we've supplied a whole buffet of pineapple options. Don't worry, we still have some of our regular options too."
You wander over to the buffet, scanning all the options. Half the table has 6 options for pineapple, and half the table has 6 options for non-pineapple.
Which do you choose?</p>

  <h1>Pineapple Pizza</h1>
<p>Being a self-proclaimed pineapple lover, you decide to try one of every pineapple option, but as you look around to find a seat, you notice that a large section of the restaurant seems to be sectioned off as it was reserved for a party. You note that they are clearly the group of people who had requested pineapple pizza options and you decide to wander over and see if you can sit with them. Upon realizing that you too enjoy pineapple on your pizza, they recognize you as one of their own and invite you to sit with them.</p>

    <!--Creating the Non-Pineapple Story Result to set up for more options-->
<div class="noPineappleContainer1" hidden="true">
  <h1>Non-Pineapple Pizza</h1>
    <p>Glaring at the pineapple pizza, you make your way to the non-pineapple options and pick and choose from a variety of pizzas. As you look around to find your seat, you realize that there are only a few places to sit. You decide to take your chances with the crowded area. It might be quiet, but at least there's not as much pineapple for you to smell on this side. You don't have to smell pineapple, and you get delicious pizza! It's a win-win!</p>
