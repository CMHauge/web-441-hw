    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Chelsey! Born and raised in Missoula, I'm a Montana girl through and through. Though I now live in Butte and like it here quite a bit, I hope to return to Missoula some day to be closer to family and friends. I have two cats and two dogs, who are basically like children to me. You'll probably see me bring them up in conversation or writing a lot. And if you know me from last semester, you're probably already used to that nonsense.</p><br>

    <h3>My Passions and Hobbies Include:</h3>
    <p>Video games, photography, graphic design, and video editing. I've recently really gotten into watching esports, because of my love for all things gaming. Honestly, if there's one way to get me to talk without being super shy, it's to bring up gaming.</p><br>

    <h3>Things I'm Looking Forward To This Semester:</h3>
    <p>I hope this semester of coding will help me further wrap my head around the things I struggled with last semester. Up until the last project or so last semsester, I found that I was understanding a good portion. I find my main struggles with coding seems to be bringing multiple elements together. I tend to easily understand things on an individual basis, but combining things is generally more difficult for me. I hope to fix that this semester. I think, for me, the process of coding is really frustrating, but I really love seeing projects come together in the end, knowing that I put the effort in and managed to create something purely from numbers and letters.</p>
