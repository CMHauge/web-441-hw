# Week 2
## "Hello World!" in Javascript
---

### No struggles:
What a relief! I didn't have any struggles this week. I actually really surprised myself. I kept thinking about deadlines coming up and kind of panicked this morning when I realized the week had gotten away from me.

Thankfully though, I started doing my code as I was reading, so when I got to the homework instructions I realized I'd already gotten half my html done just out of habit. So adding in the homework portions was **super** simple. I love it when things go smoothly!

Code I already put in out of habit:
```
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Metadata -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="description" content="MART441 HW2">
    <meta name="author" content="Chelsey Hauge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- Title -->
    <title>MART441 Homework 2 - Javascript</title>
    <!-- Light Styling -->
    <style>body{background-color: #b8f0f6;}</style>
    ```

### Natural Curiosity:
I have a little bit of experience with Javascript, although it's very minimal experience. I tend to have a sort of natural curiosity when it comes to technology, so I've messed around with Javascript in the past purely for curiosity's sake. Although that code had more to do with gaming, it was interesting (and frustrating) to learn.

I'm glad this week went really well though. Having a little bit of a break, especially after struggling with getting adjusted to a new schedule, is *really* nice.


### Conclusions:
I'm excited to move into doing Javascript. I know all things Java-related can be an absolute headache at times, so I'm taking this week to mentally prepare myself for what's to come. But over all, I'm looking forward to it. I'm hoping that I'll actually be able to wrap my head around it better this time than I did when I was learning it on my own.
