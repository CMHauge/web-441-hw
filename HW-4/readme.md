# HW-4 Readme for Chelsey Hauge

### Information Overload:
I am honestly surprised I've gotten as far as I have. There's just SO much information this week, and I feel like the reading isn't helping me much. Honestly, I kind of feel like I'm trying to jump over a large puddle after only just learning how to walk, and I am most *definitely* falling into that puddle face-first.


#### Update:
I think I'm sort of starting to wrap my head around it, after staring at number 4 for the good majority of today. I'm still pretty lost all over though. I feel like having things broken down into smaller chunks and being able to spend more time on little individual bits would make it easier to understand. All these numbers are really overwhelming.
