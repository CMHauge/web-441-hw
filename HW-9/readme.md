# HW-9 Readme

## So much information!
This week was a little overwhelming, as last week kicked my butt so I couldn't get any of the reading done last week until now, so I had a lot of catching up to do.
I got through it alright and felt like I was understanding most of what I was reading, up until I got to the actual homework assignment.

I was a little confused by the instructions, and there were so many different options that I was a little overwhelmed trying to look at it all. I ended up following the Mozilla Video and API lesson, which I'm hoping was the correct thing to do.

I tried almost every other lesson and they were either somewhat outdated or just very confusing. I really liked the Video & API lesson though, because they walked you through every step of the processes bit by bit, and thoroughly explained what each part was and why we used certain lines of code.

I like step by step things like that, rather than getting a bunch of "here's the code you need to know" and "here's what it's like in the end" without much explanation about how we got there. That kind of feels like too much of a puzzle to me, which I'm *really* bad at. So I enjoyed basically having a walkthrough of what I was supposed to be doing!

### Nearly done & last minute changes
It's been a long night. We're going on 4am now, but I'm determined to finish this.

I wasn't a fan of the fact that the tutorial used a copyrighted video, so I pulled a video from a free stock video website, that way we weren't infringing on any copyright issues. I'm also planning on adding some extra elements to the CSS to format my webpage a little better and add some of my own flair to it. Here's hoping everything goes well.

### Wrap Up and Conclusions
