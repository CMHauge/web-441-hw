### New Semester, New Struggles:

Getting back into the swing of things is always difficult, and even more so when you have so much going on. I'm going to be honest, I've had a bit of trouble trying to remember things from last semester.

I sat down to do this project the other night, and between stress and anxiety, I ended up barely touching it. Pro-tip: If you're tired, stressed, ect, take a break. Come back to it later with fresh eyes and not so sleepy. It helps **so** much.

#### Rookie Mistakes - Day 1:

One of my main struggles I had the other night is that I couldn't for the life of me figure out why my css wasn't linking properly despite my file path being correct.

As it turns out, I was too tired to realize that I had used the `{ }` brackets instead of `()`. How ridiculous of a problem is that? I was too tired to see the difference in the brackets. **Note to self:** never code when tired.

#### Progress - Day 2:

So far today has been going better. I've only been working for about an hour, and I've already fixed a billion mistakes from last night. I'm confident I can get this done in another hour or so!

#### Finished!

RWD design has been a struggle for me since last semester but I am happy to report I made it work! ...I think. It looks good to me, so I'm going to roll with it and hope it sticks.

I also threw in some fonts, because I like to keep things fancy-ish. I'm happy with how it turned out and I'm glad that I didn't forget *everything* from last semester.

Looking forward to seeing what else I can create this semester!
